# Quick-i

Quick-i is a app to create and take interviews. It's built with React, Node, Express and MongoDB.

I've used PeerJs to create a peer to peer connection. I've also used YJS to sync the data between the peers.

## Features

- Create an interview
- Take an interview
- Add questions to the interview
- Remove questions from the interview
- Collaborative editing
- Real time video chat
